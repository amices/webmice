## Step-by-step to start the API

### Clone Repository

1. Open the WEBMICE repository on GitHub [`webmice`](https://github.com/amices/webmice).
2. Download the GitHub desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com/) and install it. Reboot your PC once it is completely installed.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine by clicking the green button `Code` then choose `Open with GitHub Desktop`.

4. Open RStudio and go to `Terminal` to run `Docker code` in README file with Docker heading. However, you should setup the Docker first.
5. As an alternative, run this code in `Terminal`.
```
export WEBMICE_LOC="<location of webmice repo>"
cd "<location of webmice repo>"
Rscript webmice.R
```

### Docker Setup

1. Set up Docker Desktop by installing it from this [web](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Docker Desktop requires a minimum of 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of disk space to run.
2. In Windows, you might need to install WSL2. Open the command prompt and type `wsl --install` or if you already installed it, check for the updates `wsl --update`.
3. Do not close your Docker Desktop when trying to run below code. Keep in mind that the Dockerfile is located in the same path as your working directory.
```
docker build -t webmice -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v </path/to/local/datafolder>:/home/webmice/testdata webmice
# get a shell inside of the docker image for debugging
docker exec -it webmice bash
```
Change `</path/to/local/datafolder>`to your local path. You only need the `-v </path/to/local/datafolder>:/home/webmice/testdata` flag if you want to make some of your local data known to the docker image to use them as input data for the HTTP API. 

### Open the API
1. Go to your browser
2. Open <http://localhost:8080/doc/>
3. Try it out!
